h2. CloudFoundry

To Push to CloudFoundry, you must specify a path so it can find the war:

@vmc update beamstream --path target/scala_2.9.1/@

There is a @deploy@ task defined in sbt that will do this for you. It will only work
after an intial @vmc push@.


h2. Twitter Bootstrap

Bootstrap is included via a git submodule. When first checking out this project
you must run:

@git submodule init@

This will pull in the necessary files.

To update the version that is being used, you must run @git fetch/pull@ in the submodule
directory, then commit the version the submodule is using to the main project. For
more information, see:
